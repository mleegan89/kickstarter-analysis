# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project was to inform Louise the outcome of fundraising campaigns in relation to a campaign's launch date and initial funding goal. Using this informaton Louise may be able to further her understanding of why her play, Fever, came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. This may also be useful information for any additional plays in the future. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using the data given, we were able to analyze the outcomes of a fundraising campaign in relation to when that campaign launched. Looking at the data on the chart we are able to see that the month that had the most successful campaigns was May (111) followed by June (100). Similarly, the month wth the most faild campaigns was May (52) followed by July (50). It is interesting to note that while May had both the most successful and failed campaigns, the number of failed campaigns remained relatively consistent through all 12 months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
